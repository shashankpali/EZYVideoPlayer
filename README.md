`EZYVideoPlayer` will do all the heavy lifting that we required to create the `HLS` video player. It has all the basic and advanced functionality that a modern video player has. Just drag and drop `UIView` and inhirite it from `EZYVideoPlayer` this is all that we need to do. The `EZYVideoPlayer` is made up with `core components` and `Layers` hence it is high in performance.
The simplicity of `EZYVideoPlayer` make it the UI elegant and clear to understood by users.
